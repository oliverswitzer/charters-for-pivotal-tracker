# Developer Diary

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker enables the use of Developer Diary, which is a place for developers to document their overall woes regarding the codebase. This enables developer team members to know when it might be time for a Technical Retrospective, and documents technical insights that may have otherwise squeezed through the cracks.

Overtime, as more items are added to the Developer Diary, it will become the red. This means it's time for a retrospective!

Any of chore with a label that contains the string 'developer diary' will be displayed with a rocketship icon.
